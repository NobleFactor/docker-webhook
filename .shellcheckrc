## Repository-level shellcheck configuration
# Centralized disable list: project-wide suppressions for intentional patterns
# The team prefers some idioms (single-line declare -r assignments, deliberate
# use of indirect sourcing, certain pushd/popd usage patterns, and controlled
# eval/set usage) which produce noisy ShellCheck warnings. Keep this list
# conservative — add specific disabling here only after confirming it's a
# repository-wide policy.
#
# Disabled rules (summary):
# - SC2155: declare and assignment in same command (project prefers single-line readonly assignments)
# - SC2034: variables intentionally reserved for external/templated use
# - SC2181: prefer checking exit codes directly (scripts intentionally inspect PIPESTATUS/rc)
# - SC2154: variables that are set indirectly (sourced helpers provide them)
# - SC2004: arithmetic context warnings (portable arithmetic usage is intentional)
# - SC2086: word-splitting is deliberate in a few controlled cases (quoted where necessary)
# - SC2046: word-splitting from command substitution is intentional in a few places
# - SC2164: pushd/popd used with || exit patterns (legacy portability)
# - SC1091: Not following sourced files in static analysis (sourcing project helpers)
# - SC2317: shift after usage patterns that are safe for our parsing loop
